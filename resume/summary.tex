\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

  I'm a longtime Linux enthusiast who is at home in dynamic, collaborative environments.
  I enjoy working with a diversity of talented individuals to solve the challenging, sometimes unexpected problems that emerge at the intersection of application development and systems engineering.
  And I'm always looking to learn new technologies along the way.

  My current focus is on developing systems automation and solving operational problems for \textit{Perlmutter}, a high performance computing cluster at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.  

  %% current responsibilities include:
  %% \begin{cvitems1}
  %%   \item develop tooling for managing compute farm and user workstations
  %%   \item maintain Linux OS runtime:  compose, test, and deploy RHEL-based OS and configurations
  %%   \item automate reporting to inform ongoing operations and structure future plans
  %%   \item manage projects from end to end, taking the lead or following others as it makes sense
  %%   %% \item mentor and train team members
  %%   \item troubleshoot OS-level problems for Application Developers, QA, Support, Desktop
  %%   \item \emph{Help, I don't know who else to ask!}
