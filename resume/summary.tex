\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

  Now working on development and operations for Pixar's datacenter-hosted workstation infrastructure.

  % \begin{cvbox}
  I'm a longtime enthusiast for the Linux desktop who enjoys working in a dynamic, highly collaborative environment like an animation studio.
  I like to engage with a diverse group of talented individuals---to solve the challenging, sometimes unexpected problems that emerge from creative tensions between artists and engineers.
  And I'm always looking to learn new technologies along the way.
