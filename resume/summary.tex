\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

  Now working on development and operations for Pixar's Linux-based compute farm and user workstations.

  I'm a longtime Linux enthusiast seeking work in a dynamic, collaborative environment.
  I enjoy working with a diversity of talented individuals to solve the challenging, sometimes unexpected problems that emerge at the intersection of application development and systems engineering.
  And I'm looking to learn new technologies along the way.

  Current responsibilities include:
  \begin{cvitems1}
    \item develop tooling for managing compute farm and user workstations
    \item maintain Linux OS runtime:  compose, test, and deploy RHEL-based OS and configurations
    \item automate reporting to inform ongoing operations and structure future plans
    \item manage projects from end to end, taking the lead or following others as it makes sense
    %% \item mentor and train team members
    \item troubleshoot OS-level problems for Application Developers, QA, Support, Desktop
    \item \emph{Help, I don't know who else to ask!}
  \end{cvitems1}

  Tools I use every day:
  \begin{itemize*}[]
    \item[] Python  % empty optional arg omits the bullet point
    \item Ansible
    \item Systemd
    \item Docker
    \item Git
    \item Rpm
    \item Emacs
    \item Bash
    \item Qemu-Kvm
    \item Teradici
    \item clear, respectful prose.
  \end{itemize*}
