\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
  I'm a longtime Linux enthusiast seeking work in a dynamic, collaborative environment.
  I enjoy working with a diversity of talented individuals to solve the challenging, sometimes unexpected problems that emerge at the intersection of application development and systems engineering.
  I can manage projects from end to end, taking the lead or following others as it makes sense.
  And I'm always looking to learn new technologies along the way.
